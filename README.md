JS Game
This game was built as a bootcamp project for web development. The goal of this game was not to build the HTML or CSS sheets but to write the JS using jQuery. This was a great project and without any supports other than Google I was able to complete it in roughly 3 hours. It was not the complexity of the game that caused the delay but it was the learning the different methods available within jQuery. 

I am uploading this basic game for now but will later use my Flask app to add a txt file so that the high score can be displayed and saved with every passing game.
